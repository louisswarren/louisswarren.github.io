Research Interests
==================

My primary research is in minimal logic. Minimal logic is a generalisation of
intuitionistic logic in which *ex falso quodlibet* is not assumed. This leaves
no axioms regarding negation or absurdity. In fact, absurdity is just a
proposition, which may or may not hold. For this reason, minimal logic may be
thought of as the positive fragment of logic.

Minimal Reverse mathematics
---------------------------
Reverse mathematics over minimal logic - classification and separation of
classical tautologies which are not minimally derivable. Specifically, I
examine principles in predicate logic. These include the 'omniscience
principles' like
[LPO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_principle_of_omniscience)), and
related principles like the [drinker
paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinker_paradox).

Minimal analysis
----------------
Analysis over minimal logic.

* Required changes to the Peano axioms in order to obtain a definition of the
  rational numbers in minimal logic.
* Modifications of proofs in Bishop's constructive analysis to remove reliance
  on EFQ and disjunctive syllogism.
* Non-standard analysis over minimal logic.
