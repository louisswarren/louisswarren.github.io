title: How to configure my Raspberry Pi
---

These instructions are very bare, and intended only for my own use.

1. Write the disk image to the sd card with `dd`, using `BS=4M`.

2. Resize the second partition to ~1.5GiB, create an ext4 partition on the
remaining space for media storage.

3. Start the Pi and ssh in, username `pi`, password `raspberry`.

4. Run `raspi-config`, reboot.

5. Get updates/upgrades.

6. Run `adduser`.

7. Use `usermod -a -G <comma separated groups> louis` to add pi's groups
   to new user.

8. Add new user to sudoers.

9. Verify the new user works and can `sudo`, then disable the pi account with
   `passwd -l pi`.

10. Add the extra partition to `fstab`, using `defaults,noatime 0 2`.

11. Run `addgroup local` and `adduser louis local`.

12. Run `chgrp local /local`.
