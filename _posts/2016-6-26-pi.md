** Notes on how to configure my Raspberry Pi

These are very bare, and of use only to people already very familiar with linux.

1. Write the disk image to the sd card with `dd`, using `BS=4M`.

2. Resize the second partition to ~1.5GiB, create an ext4 partition on the
remaining space for media storage.

3. Start the Pi and ssh in, username `pi`, password `raspberry`.

4. Run `raspi-config`, reboot.

5. Get updates/upgrades.

6. Run `adduser`.

7. Use `usermod -a -G <comma separated groups> <username>` to add pi's groups
   to new user.

8. Add new user to sudoers.

9. Verify the new user works and can `sudo`, then disable the pi account with
   `passwd -l pi`.
