title: Windows 11
---

A running log of my first hour of using windows 11.

* Taskbar no longer has a small icons option, so now my taskbar is twice as
  tall as before
* Taskbar item size scales down with label size, so a window called "settings"
  has a very narrow taskbar entry. Previously these would all be uniform size.
* Powershell colourscheme profiles don't apply correctly. I have to change them
  back and forth to get them to apply. The "Default" profile doesn't seem to do
  anything.
* Selecting a different theme in powershell does not take effect until you
  click "Save". There is no option to preview it.
* The Solarized Light colourscheme is misconfigured so highlighted text is very
  hard to see (e.g. the `config` in `git config --list`.
* The Solarized Dark colourscheme is misconfigured so option arguments are very
  hard to see (e.g. the `--list` in `git config --list`.
