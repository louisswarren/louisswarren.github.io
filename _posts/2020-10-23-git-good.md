Slides for a talk I gave explaining Git.

#### Abstract

As you work on your Copy of Copy of thesis (3), you may wish for a cleaner way
to manage versions of your work. When the terminal servers are being patched
and file server goes down for maintenance, you might fret about whether you
emailed the newest version of your paper to yourself. While collaborating with
other researches, you will eventually find it inconvenient to paste your LaTeX
paragraphs into Facebook messenger group chats.

This talk is a practical introduction to Git, a distributed version control
system. It will cover basic usage, an explanation of what Git actually does,
along with basic troubleshooting.
