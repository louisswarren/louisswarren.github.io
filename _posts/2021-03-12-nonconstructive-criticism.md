Notes for a talk I gave on constructivism

#### Abstract

Constructivism is the philosophy that
the existence of mathematical objects must be proven
by demonstrating how to find them.
Proof by contradiction is a non-constructive technique,
and the law of excluded middle (that every statement is either true or false)
cannot be taken as a universal truth in constructive logics.
In this talk, we examine common non-constructive proofs, and show how they can
be made constructive.
These constructive proofs have aesthetic value in a classical setting.
We see that some basic propositions of classical logic
cannot be made constructive.
