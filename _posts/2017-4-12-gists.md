Many code snippets I write are available at [gist.lsw.nz](http://gist.lsw.nz).
Some snippets are very useful to me, and are (I believe) nicely written. Others
are just amusing, should not be used for any practical purposes. Proceed with
caution.


Useful
------
* [Program for renaming many files at once using your preferred text editor.](
  https://gist.github.com/louisswarren/9e2281df7fe559e6ccbffb07bc307d03)
* [Implementation of an algorithm which either proves or disproves a given
  statement in the implicational fragment of minimal logic.](
  https://gist.github.com/louisswarren/a5abb327639786647cbabf72a6e40385)
  Code-wise, this is a little ugly, as the main function is over fifty lines
  long.


Amusing
-------
* [A python decorator for tail-recursion.](
  https://gist.github.com/louisswarren/27d8e03cbfe867cd22750348e1781857) Not
  necessarily a bad idea, but not indended to be a good idea.
* [Using python's `set` class as a flag - essentially a pun.](
  https://gist.github.com/louisswarren/cdd0002e47b837626e3df97076b55892)


Both?
-----
* [Password generator which generates multi-word passwords which are easy for
  touch-typists to type.](
  https://gist.github.com/louisswarren/92da1771fe8feee1f1708e0f4c303b3e) Can be
  set up for your own eccentric/incorrect typing style. Not necessarily safe;
  while the theoretic entropy is given, I have no idea if python's randomness
  is sufficient here. Perhaps this is the starting point of a useful tool.
