I have written a template for latex. Its primary feature is the included
Makefile, which enables easy compilation, recompilation for fixing references,
and compatibility with bibtex. It also features the capability of compiling a
document as a draft purely through the command-line. This is completely
customisable; by default it turns on `todonotes`, `showlabels`, and shows the
relevant git commit information.
