title: Take Off!!! The Game
---

The Sekander Corporation completed development of a game called "Take Off!!!" in 2006, as shown from its (now defunct) official website.

I dug up the executable, dated 17th May 2006. Apparently I liked particle
effects. Unfortunately I have no idea what the ending screen looks like; this
game is rather difficult.

The game's music was written by Sebastian Warren.
