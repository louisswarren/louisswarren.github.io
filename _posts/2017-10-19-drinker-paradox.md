title: Seminar on Classifying the Drinker Paradox and its Dual
---

Slides for a seminar I gave at Swansea University and the University of Padua

# Update
A paper on this topic has since been written (see
[here](/drinker-paradox-paper)).

##### Abstract

Informally, the drinker paradox may be stated as "in every non-empty pub there
is a person such that if that person is drinking, everybody in the pub is
drinking". The dual of the drinker paradox is a formulation of Hilbert's
epsilon operator for the existential quantifier. Both are theorems of classical
logic, but non-constructive. They are independent of each other, and of the law
of excluded middle, but each is sufficient to derive the limited principle of
omniscience for binary sequences, and thus is analytically powerful. Kripke
semantics can be used to classify the strength of these statements over
intuitionistic and minimal logic.
