title: p-adic Numbers

The report for my honours project.


##### Abstract

For each prime p, the p-adic numbers Qp are a distinct completion of the
rational numbers. We justify the significance of the p-adic absolute value, and
use it to construct the p-adic numbers. We look at some of their properties,
and examine the behaviour of power series over the p-adic numbers. We also
construct the smallest algebraically closed complete space containing Qp.
