At the risk of imitating Richard Stallman, I will be using this page to note
maths jokes which I don't want to forget.

* Taxi-cab number 14

* Why did the chicken cross the road? Intermediate value theorem.

* Why did the chicken cross the road? *Proof omitted*.

* How many mathematicians does it take to change a lightbulb? One, who hands it
  to three blondes, thereby reducing the situation to a previously solved
  problem.
